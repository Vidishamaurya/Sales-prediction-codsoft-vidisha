📊 Sales Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting product sales based on advertising expenditure across different media platforms such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper.
Using Machine Learning (Linear Regression), the model analyzes how marketing investments impact overall sales.

This project is part of my Data Science Internship and demonstrates the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

🧠 Problem Statement

Companies invest heavily in advertising but often lack clarity on:

Which advertising medium contributes most to sales?

How much sales can be expected for a given ad budget?

The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates sales based on advertising spend.

📂 Dataset Description

Dataset Name: advertising.csv

Features:

TV – Advertising budget spent on TV

Radio – Advertising budget spent on Radio

Newspaper – Advertising budget spent on Newspaper

Target Variable:

Sales – Product sales

⚙️ Technologies Used

Libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Checked for missing values

Visualized feature relationships using pair plots

Analyzed correlations with a heatmap

Observed strong correlation between TV advertising and Sales

🧪 Machine Learning Model

Algorithm Used: Linear Regression

Why Linear Regression?

Simple and interpretable

Suitable for continuous target variables

Helps understand the impact of each advertising medium

📈 Model Evaluation Metrics

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score

These metrics help evaluate prediction accuracy and model reliability.

🚀 Results

The model successfully predicts sales based on advertising budgets

TV advertising shows the highest influence on sales

Achieved a strong R² score, indicating good model performance
